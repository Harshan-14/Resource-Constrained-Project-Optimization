# Resource-Constrained-Project-Optimization
Resource Constraint Project Scheduling Problem(RCPSP) helps us to address the uncertainties in task duration, costs and the results of the task using discrete time Markov chain which enables us to model probabilistic correlation of the uncertain parameters.
